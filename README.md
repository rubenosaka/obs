# OBS Angular APP
by Rubén González Aranda

Using the API specified on the next page, create an Angular application to manage a list of tasks.
The home page of the application should be a list of all tasks. From here you should be able to create
a new task, update a task and remove a task, and additionally provide the following functionalities:
- Mark a task as complete
- List only completed tasks
- List only pending tasks
You are free to use a CSS framework such as bootstrap, angular material or create your own
stylesheet to make it look decent but don&#39;t focus on the design - we prefer you spend your time
making your code beautiful instead.
